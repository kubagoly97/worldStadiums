# World Stadiums

World Stadiums is a web platform where registered users can contribute to a comprehensive database of football stadiums from around the globe. Users have the ability to add, edit, rate, and comment on football stadiums, creating a dynamic and interactive hub for football enthusiasts. The application is built using JavaScript, EJS, Express, Node.js, MongoDB, HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap 5. Several third-party libraries and services, such as Mapbox, Cloudinary, Passport.js, Mongoose, Helmet, Joi, UUID, Sanitize-html, and Multer, enhance the functionality and security of the application.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Utilizes Passport.js for secure user authentication.
- **Stadium Management:** Allows users to add new stadiums, edit existing ones, and contribute to the growing database.
- **Rating and Comments:** Users can rate and provide comments on their favorite (or least favorite) stadiums.
- **Map Integration:** Utilizes Mapbox for an interactive map display of stadium locations.
- **Image Handling:** Cloudinary and Multer are employed for efficient and secure image storage and retrieval.
- **Data Validation:** Joi is used for input validation, ensuring data integrity.
- **Security:** Helmet enhances security by setting various HTTP headers.
- **Unique Identifiers:** UUID generates unique identifiers for each stadium entry.
- **Sanitization:** Sanitize-html helps prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks by sanitizing user input.
